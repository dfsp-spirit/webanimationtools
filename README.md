# webanimationtools

Some tools and proof-of-concept code for web bases animations.

See the README file of the different tools for details:

* [svg2apng](./svg2apng): convert an animated SVG file to an APNG file.
    * Includes two scripts, one to convert the SVG to a series of PNG images, and a second one that converts those PNG images into a single APNG file.
* [replacesvgfillcolors](./replacesvgfillcolors): replace fill colors in a n SVG file to create a new, re-colored version of the image
